# data2019nCoV R Package

This R package stores data about the 2019-2020 COVID-19 pandemic (SARS-CoV-2). 

The date is transcribed or compiled from official sources, but there is no guarantee as to the accuracy of the transcribed data or graphs in the vignettes. Please file an issue if any errors (discrepancies with official reports) are noticed.

Currently, this package contains 4 datasets. 

### World Health Organization (WHO)

`WHO_SR`: The transcribed WHO [situation reports](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports) up to 2020-04-04 (Situation Reports # 1-75).

### Ontario

`ON_cumulative`: The source of this data is the official Ontario Government's [website](https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus). Data is included from page updates that were captured by the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus) where possible. It has been updated as of 2020-04-05.

`ON_mohreports`: This object contains the data in the Public Health Ontario/Ontario Ministry of Health "Epidemiologic Summary" reports, published daily from 2020-03-29. It is updated as of 2020-03-05.

### Canada

`CAN_cumulative`: The source of this data is the official Canadian Government's [website](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html). Data is included from page updates that were captured by the Internet Archive where possible. It has been updated up to 2020-03-27. After this time, the government started releasing CSVs containing the full data. 

## Demo

Plots of the WHO data can be found in the [WHO SR vignette](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eebrown/data2019nCoV/blob/master/doc/WHO_SR.html). 

Plots of the Ontario data can be found in the [ON vignette](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eebrown/data2019nCoV/blob/master/doc/ON_cumulative.html).

Plots of the Canada data can be found in the [CAN vignette](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eebrown/data2019nCoV/blob/master/doc/Canada.html).

## Usage

The package can be installed via `devtools::install_github("eebrown/data2019nCoV")`. Be sure to reinstall to obtain the latest version as new data is released (including the errata periodically reported by WHO).

Once the package is installed and loaded, the data is available in a data.frame object, `WHO_SR`. This package uses plain lanugage variable names. The data is also available in the object `sarscov2_who_2019`, which uses more systematic variable names. The latter object also appears in the package [`outbreaks`](https://github.com/reconhub/outbreaks), though may be slightly less updated there.

### Wiki

If you use the data for a project, please consider adding the project link to the [wiki](https://github.com/eebrown/data2019nCoV/wiki). If you verify the data (confirm it to be equivalent to the WHO Situation Reports), please also consider noting that on the wiki. The purpose is to facilitate data analysis in this rapidly evolving pandemic. 

### Data Structure

Raw/transcribed data are stored as `.csv` files in the `/data-raw` directory, e.g. `/data-raw/WHO_SR.csv`. The scripts that converted the raw data into an R object are in a corresponding `.R` file in that directory (e.g. `/data-raw/WHO_SR.R`).
